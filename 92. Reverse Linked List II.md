Reverse a linked list from position m to n. Do it in one-pass.

Note: 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ length of list.

Example:

Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, m = 2, n = 4
Output: 1->4->3->2->5->NULL
<p>




<h3>解题<h3>
<p>treat the linklist as if it's three linklist:
 find the end of first linklist, get second linklist reversed(and get the last node of second list), get the 
 beginning node of third list. connect all the three list<p>




<h3>细节<h3>
<p>
use dummy node at beginning.
