<h3>题意<h3>
<p>Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.<p>

<h3>解题<h3>
<p>use two pointer, i1 record the latest index that word1 occur, i2 record the latest index that word2 occur. Keep finding the min value of 
abs(i1-i2)<p>

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestDistance(self, wordsDict: List[str], word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        i1 = -1
        i2 = -1
        minDis = len(wordsDict)
        for i in range(len(wordsDict)):
            if wordsDict[i] == word1:
                i1 = i
            if wordsDict[i] == word2:
                i2 = i
            if i1 != -1 and i2 != -1:
                minDis = min(minDis, abs(i1-i2))
        return minDis
 ```
