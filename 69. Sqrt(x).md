Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

<p>binary search, end is half of the original number plus one. each round, compare mid*mid vs x. then change start/end. <p>




<h3>细节<h3>
<p>
Always use the one which is lower than the number: 
        if end * end > x:
            return start
        else:
            return end

    def mySqrt(self, x):

        :rtype: int

        if x == 1:
            return 1
        
        start = 0
        end = x / 2 + 1
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = (start + end) / 2
            if mid * mid == x:
                return mid
            elif mid * mid > x:
                end = mid
            else:
                start = mid
        if end * end > x:
            return start
        else:
            return end
```
