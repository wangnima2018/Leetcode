Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

 

Example:



Input:
{"$id":"1","neighbors":[{"$id":"2","neighbors":[{"$ref":"1"},{"$id":"3","neighbors":[{"$ref":"2"},{"$id":"4","neighbors":[{"$ref":"3"},{"$ref":"1"}],"val":4}],"val":3}],"val":2},{"$ref":"4"}],"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 2's value is 2, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
Node 3's value is 3, and it has two neighbors: Node 2 and 4.
Node 4's value is 4, and it has two neighbors: Node 1 and 3.
 

Note:

The number of nodes will be between 1 and 100.
The undirected graph is a simple graph, which means no repeated edges and no self-loops in the graph.
Since the graph is undirected, if node p has node q as neighbor, then node q must have node p as neighbor too.
You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

<h3>解题<h3>
<p>需要反复看： 用dict记录old node 和 new node对应关系。使用bst来遍历整个graph
   关键点在于，如果把旧的node的neighbor，都map到新的node都neighbor上面<p>

```python
# Definition for a undirected graph node
# class UndirectedGraphNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.label = x
#         self.neighbors = []

class Solution:
    # @param node, a undirected graph node
    # @return a undirected graph node
    # BST
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        if node is None:
            return None
        d = {}
        q = [node]
        newNode = UndirectedGraphNode(node.label)
        d[node] = newNode 
        while q:
            cur = q.pop(0)
            for n in cur.neighbors:
                # 如果新的node还没有被init
                if n not in d:
                    copy = UndirectedGraphNode(n.label)
                    d[cur].neighbors.append(copy)
                    d[n] = copy
                    q.append(n)
                # 如果新的node已经被init，只需要增加对应关系就好了
                else:
                    d[cur].neighbors.append(d[n])
        return newNode
                    
```
