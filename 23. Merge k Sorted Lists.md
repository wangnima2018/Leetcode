<h3>题意<h3>
<p>
Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

Example:

Input:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

<p>maintain a heap ds, to save/compare each list current node and find the smallest one in each round<p>




<h3>细节<h3>
<p>
learned how to use heap API, and also how to compare values while maintain listNode in heap:
heapq.heappush(heap,(pop[1].next.val,pop[1].next))
<p>
  
<h3>细节1<h3>
<p>
how tuple is compared in python: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5292303/how-does-tuple-comparison-work-in-python
Tuples are compared position by position: the first item of the first tuple is compared to the first item of the second tuple; if they are not equal (i.e. the first is greater or smaller than the second) then that's the result of the comparison, else the second item is considered, then the third and so on.

```python
#heapq.heappop(heap)
#Pop and return the smallest item from the heap, maintaining the heap invariant. If the heap is empty, IndexError is raised. To access the smallest item without popping it, use heap[0].

# headq API:
"""
headq.heapify(heap)
headp.heappop()
headq.heappush()
"""

class Solution(object):
    def mergeKLists(self, lists):
        """
        :type lists: List[ListNode]
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        heap = []
        for node in lists:
            if node:
                heap.append((node.val,node))
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        head = ListNode(0)
        cur = head
        while heap:
            pop = heapq.heappop(heap)
            cur.next = ListNode(pop[0])
            cur = cur.next
            if pop[1].next:
                heapq.heappush(heap,(pop[1].next.val,pop[1].next))
        res = head.next
        head.next = None
        return res
```
